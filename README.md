Have fun – That’s the whole point.

No cheating – Beat the games fair and square.

No spamming – This isn’t your grandma’s inbox.

Respect others – Play nice or don’t play at all.

No bad vibes – Leave drama at the door.

Don’t abuse bugs – If you find one, congrats... now tell me.

No linking sketchy stuff – Keep it clean-ish.

Use headphones – Some games make noise.

No requesting unblocked sites in chat – Just explore what’s here.

You break it, you buy it – Just kidding… but seriously, don’t mess with the code.
